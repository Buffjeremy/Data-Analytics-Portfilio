Jeremiah Schantz - Data & Analytics Portfolio

About Me

Hello! I'm Jeremiah Schantz, an insightful and adaptable professional with over 20 years of cross-functional experience in education, technical repair, and hospitality, now transitioning my passion for problem-solving into data science. I'm driven by using data to understand complex behaviors, optimize processes, and inform strategic decisions.

My diverse background has equipped me with strong analytical thinking, troubleshooting skills, and the ability to communicate complex concepts clearly. I thrive on extracting meaningful insights from data and translating them into actionable solutions.

I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate (July 2025), solidifying my technical foundation in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools. I'm eager to apply my analytical mindset and growing data science expertise to new challenges.

Technical Skills

Here's a snapshot of my technical toolkit:

    Languages & Tools: Python (basic), SQL, Spreadsheets, Tableau (basic), Jupyter Notebooks

    Systems: Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS

    Analytics: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Reasoning

    Other: Network Troubleshooting, Device Repair, Process Optimization, Cross-Functional Communication

Featured Projects
To first hone my data analytic skills I did a study involving splitting checks while I was waiting tables. For every check that I split in two, I gave one sample group one pen to share to calculate the tip, while I have a second sample group two pens so that each party had their own individual pen. I then kept track of all the check amounts and the tip amounts. My initial assumption was that the group that had to share a pen may tip higher because the sharing of the pen would initate conversation amongst the parties about tip. You can find the results of my study [here](waiting_tables_data.xlsx).
